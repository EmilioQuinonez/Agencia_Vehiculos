# Vehicle Agency Manager
In this repository, you can find a codebase designed to manage a vehicle inventory. This includes a comprehensive collection of details about the available vehicles and functionalities that allow customers and employees to interact with the inventory in various ways. Additionally, you will find a UML diagram that provides a detailed explanation of the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships present in the code.

Some of the functionalities included in this code are: vehicle display, allowing customers and employees to view the list of available vehicles; vehicle purchase, enabling customers to buy vehicles from the inventory; price comparison, so that customers can compare the prices of two selected vehicles; and vehicle addition, which allows employees to add new vehicles to the inventory. It is important to note that any changes made will not be saved once the code execution is complete, as it does not have a save function.

The code operates interactively. Once started, the user must input the information requested by the program during its execution. It includes a main menu where the user can select whether they are a customer or an employee. Depending on the selection, the user will be directed to either a customer menu allowing them to view vehicles, purchase vehicles, and compare prices or an employee menu allowing them to view vehicles and add new ones.
