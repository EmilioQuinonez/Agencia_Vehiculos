# Vehicle Agency Manager
In this repository you can find a code that allows you to manage a vehicle inventory, providing a complete collection of details about the available vehicles and allowing customers and employees to interact with this inventory in various ways, in addition you can find a UML diagram that explains in detail the classes, attributes, methods and relationships found in the code.

Some of the functionalities that are in this code are the following, vehicle display because customers and employees can see the list of available vehicles, vehicle purchase because customers can purchase vehicles that are in the inventory, price comparison so that customers can compare the prices of two selected vehicles, and vehicle addition so that employees can add new vehicles to the inventory. We have to keep in mind that once the code is finalized the changes that have been made will not be saved as it does not have a save function.

The code has an interactive operation, that is to say that once it is started, the user must enter the information that the program requests throughout its execution. The code includes a main menu that allows the user to select whether he/she is a customer or an employee, a customer menu that allows the customer to view vehicles, purchase vehicles and compare prices between vehicles, and finally an employee menu that allows the employee to view vehicles and add new vehicles.
